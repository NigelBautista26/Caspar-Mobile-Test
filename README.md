# My Thoughts and Explanation...

Here is a brief explanation on why i did the test this way, firstly, i really wanted to not use testing tools like Katalon for this test as i wanted more control and grip when it comes to my tests, Next i chose to write the test in Javascript because its what im most comfortable with at this stage in my career, also i think that the best framework thats currently available is WebdriverIO, along with Mocha and Chai, it is very reliable and powerful and at the same time fits perfectly with the page object model architecture that i chose because of one simple reason, it really does have a great advantage of mirrorring the applications architecture. therfore makes it easier to map. it makes it simple and precise.

# Technology used.....
Script: Javascript.
